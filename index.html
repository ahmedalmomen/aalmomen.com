         <p> My name is Ahmed Al Momen and I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University
         in Boston, while working part time as a Hardware Engineering intern at Tagup. As an aspiring Chemical Engineer I hope 
         to one day work in the oil and gas industry as I have an unpretentious and genuine interest in petroleum refining and 
         petrochemical production.<br /><br />Throughout high school, and all the way through college I have had the opportunity 
         to work in laboratory environments. Of these experiences the most significant were both my Organic Chemistry I & II labs 
         as well as my Transport I & II labs, where I was able to familiarize myself with different laboratory equipment as well as 
         collaboratively work with my colleagues to come up with and conduct different experiments pertaining to reaction kinetics, 
         filtration, pipetting, distillation, centrifuging, crystallization and much more. In addition I have successfully completed 
         the “Chemical Hygiene Training Part 1 & 2 - Lab Safety and Hazardous Waste Management” Program.
         Likewise my coursework has also provided me with a wide-range of knowledge and tools that will assist me in absorbing, analyzing,
         and solving real world engineering problems.<br /><br />Aside from my lab experience and coursework, I posses a range of valuable 
         skills and qualities such as being an independent yet collaborative, driven and motivated individual. Furthermore, I am very 
         organized and posses strong communication skills. With regards to technical skills, I am proficient in AutoCAD and SolidWorks and 
         familiar with C++ HTML and MATLAB.</p>
